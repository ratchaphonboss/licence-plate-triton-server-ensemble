# licence-plate-triton-server-ensemble
Triton backend that enables pre-processing, post-processing and other logic to be implemented in Python. In the repository, I use tech stack including YOLOv8, ONNX, EasyOCR, Triton Inference Server, CV2, Docker, and K8S. All of which we deploy on k80 and use CUDA 11.4
